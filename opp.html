        AI security cameras provide a majority of answers to the clients
        security problems. Reviewing video footage to gather more information
        about events, may appear simple, but without AI video analytics, they
        can be extremely difficult and time-consuming. Security personnel
        working on large campuses and business premises such as airports,
        universities, supermarkets, and other similar locations would
        acknowledge this.

        Even so, such locations have thousands of cameras installed, and each
        camera runs continuously, amassing massive amounts of video footage,
        making searching for this data time consuming and expensive.
        Nevertheless, it is critical for investigations and law enforcement
        officers, which is where AI video analytics can come in handy. Modern
        AI-powered video surveillance systems allow users to search for a
        specific action or object in all footage much faster than before.

        Artificial intelligence in security cameras has begun to make an effect
        on human jobs. This trend will continue as these technologies become
        more advanced and developed. Employers no longer need to hire people who
        spend the majority of their time sitting in front of computer screens
        and staring at nothing, thanks to AI-based surveillance systems.
