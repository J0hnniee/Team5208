      <h2>PROPOSAL</h2>
      <p>
        Security cameras are video cameras that are used to monitor space. They
        frequently have an IP network or recording device linked to them. With
        the rapid growth of technology, especially Artificial Intelligence, a
        number of new ways have been approached to present AI into the video
        surveillance system. Artificial Intelligence for video surveillance
        employs computer software programs that analyse audio and image data.
        However, is it really a good choice to rely on artificial intelligence
        that may be able to renovate the entire surveillance industry?
      </p>
      <p>
        In choosing this topic, we are attempting to determine whether
        Artificial Intelligence is actually advantageous or disadvantageous to
        many of our security applications nowadays. We were particularly
        interested in seeing if it constitutes a security breach or is totally
        beneficial with unlimited functionality and close to 100% accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relevance: Security cameras using Artificial Intelligence are typically
        much more accurate than conventional ones since they remove the
        possibility of human error. But Artificial Intelligence isnâ€™t perfect so
        the accuracy of them are never truly 100% even with the most advanced
        type of Artificial Intelligence. When reviewing security camera footage,
        humans can tell what is truly happening whereas AI is not 100% accurate
        in spotting those boundary cases.
