      <h2>RISKS & CHOICES</h2>
      <p>
        Because of its self-learning capabilities, AI is having a significant
        impact. It now detects objects in the real world, compares the results
        to correct annotations, and attempts to improve further. It is
        constantly learning and improving in this manner. With each iteration,
        errors are reduced and get closer, or even better than human error. AI
        may diminish some of today’s valuable employment opportunities. These
        developments will result to an extremely real and worrisome future in
        which artificial intelligence, and will replace a significant proportion
        of human jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the advancement of artificial intelligence has exciting
        repercussions for reassuring humans of the burden of slaving away at
        jobs, it will also result in massive unemployment, leaving many people
        unemployed indefinitely. In the article “Toward understanding the impact
        of artificial intelligence on labor” published by PNAS, it was found
        that 47% of current US employment is at high risk of automation. This is
        a problem that must be addressed immediately. Massive permanent
        unemployment can cause major societal disruption and a significant
        increase in crime rates. A glimpse into the near future portrays a world
        in which many jobs will be automated.
      </p>
      <h3>How AI impacts the future of jobs?</h3>
      <p>
        Whereas artificial intelligence and automation are not new technologies,
        their ability to take over jobs in a wide range of occupations has just
        began. While this may be beneficial to companies because they will no
        longer have to pay humans to perform tasks, it will be damaging to the
        majority of people who are unable to find work.
