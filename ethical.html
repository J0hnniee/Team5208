      <h1>Ethical Reflections</h1>
      <br />
      <h3><bold>Johnny Set (21148751)</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence has been the topic of the future for quite a while now. It is used every day in
          various ways, whether it is in facial recognition for your phone, in streaming sites that are constantly
          using the data from the user by using machine learning algorithms, or in Surveillance Cameras, which
          is the topic that I have chosen and will be reflecting on.</p>

        <p>AI Surveillance Cameras have Artificial Intelligence Software built into the cameras which can detect
          objects e.g., cars, trucks, bikes, humans, and faces. More and more countries are using AI-based
          surveillance which is mostly supplied by the United States and China. It is shown that at least 75 out
          of 176 countries are actively using AI-based surveillance.</p>

        <p>The problem that worries people the most is the dangers of AI-based surveillance. They can pose a
          major threat to our privacy. The difference between normal cameras and AI-based cameras is that
          normal cameras only record objects in motion while AI-based cameras analyse them. AI-based
          cameras also can allow authorities to go back and search through thousands and thousands of video
          footage and find what they are specifically looking for with a simple filtered search. This turns our
          normal security cameras into the smartest AI security guards that will always be watching us at every
          moment. This type of technology can easily be put into the wrong hands which pose a major threat
          to our future where we feel constantly monitored.</p>

        <p>However, when AI-based surveillance cameras are used for the right reasons and the right purposes,
           they could be beneficial as well. It could help the Police catch criminals much faster than they can
           without it. According to the FBI, in 2019, over 73% of property crimes in the US leads to a loss of
           billions of dollars, most of which could have been prevented with AI-based surveillance. Unlike the
           average human, the cameras can run 24/7 and have real-time threat detection so they can alert
           officers on duty much faster.</p>
           
        <p>Overall, AI-based surveillance can have both a positive and negative impact which is based on how
          people interpret it and how people use it. But we still need to take precautions and provide strong
          privacy protections to make sure we donâ€™t end up in a world where we are constantly being
          watched.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is developing at an exceedingly fast rate. One of the critical concerns for ethical reflection right now is the capability of artificial intelligence, which has expanded quickly. Here I will be reflecting on different areas of AI being used in video surveillance for ethics.</p>
          <p>Artificial intelligence is developing at an exceedingly fast rate. One of the critical concerns for ethical reflection right now is the capability of artificial intelligence, which has expanded quickly. Here I will be reflecting on different areas of AI being used in video surveillance for ethics.</p>
          <p>We believe that artificial intelligence for video surveillance may significantly benefit society. No matter what, the people sitting in front of surveillance camera footage have a natural tendency to have their own personal biological facial recognition. By minimizing the need for human observers while resolving a security issue, the implementation of algorithmic security solutions may increase privacy. Solutions are to be made with privacy in mind: AI security systems don't require video storage and don't use any personal data.</p>
